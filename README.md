# Zeitpages

In its current state, this is a one man, 6 hour hackathon project. It's a react frontend connected to a express/node/knex/postgres backend in its present state. You can see the site at https://zeitpages-front-end.michaelharms6010.now.sh 

Todo:
- Styling
- Better form Validation
- Any user testing sure would be nice
- Streamline user flow

## Backend

The backend is currently hosted in a staging environment on a free heroku server. Its source code and deployment information can be seen here: https://github.com/michaelharms6010/be-zeitpages
